Beneath the sky so vast and blue,
The morning wakes with drops of dew.
A whisper floats on winds so light,
The stars retreat, surrender night.
A flower leans toward golden gleam,
Still tangled in a fading dream.
Time drips in silence, slow and sweet,
As sun and shadow gently meet—
The world begins, its heart complete.
