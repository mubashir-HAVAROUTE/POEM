Beneath the sky so vast and blue,
The morning wakes with drops of dew.
A whisper floats on winds so light,
The stars retreat, surrender night.
A flower leans toward golden gleam,
Still tangled in a fading dream.
Time drips in silence, slow and sweet,
As sun and shadow gently meet—
The world begins, its heart complete
when the day come they will smile.
god's people they are 
safwan and mubashir and musthafa
